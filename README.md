## Chapter 1 - Java Fundamentals
The Origins of Java

- Java was conceived by James Goling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at **Sun Microsystems** in **1991**

- purpose is to create consumer electronic devices such as toasters, microwave oven and remote control.

- Problem is most computer languages were design into machine code that specific only in the target CPU.

- Attempt to find better solution, Gosling and the others worked on a portable, cross-platform language that could produce a code in any CPU's and Environments

- It was the Internet that ultimately led to Java's large-scale success.

Java's Lineage: C and C++

- Java's closest ancestor are C and C++.

- From C, Java inherits its syntax

- Java's Object model is adapted from C++.

### Java's Magic: The Bytecode
- The key that allowed Java to address both the security and the portability problems is that the output of a Java compiler is not executable, rather its a bytecode.

- **Bytecode** is a highly optimized set of instructions that can be executed via *Java Virtual Machine*, which is a part of Java Runtime Environment(JRE).

- JVM was designed as an interpreted of bytecodes.

Java servlet  is a program that executes on a server.

## The Java Buzzwords
Title | Description
--- | ---
Simple | Java is easy to learn and use
Secure | Java provides security
Portable | Java programs can be execute in any environment
Object-Oriented | Java embodies mordern Object-Oriented

### Object-Oriented Programming
At the center of Java is object-oriented programming(OOP). The object-oriented methodology is inseparable from Java.

## Java's
- Encapsulation (Black Box) - is a programming mechanism that binds together and the data it manipulates, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

> The code and data consitute a class are called members or member variables/instance variables.

- Polymorphism - *from Greek, meaning "Many Forms"* is the quality that allows on interface to access a general class of actions.

- Inheritance - is the process by which one object can acquire the propertiesof another object.
